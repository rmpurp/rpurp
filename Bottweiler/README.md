# Bottweiler
A bot that detects edits in your Discord channel, and allows recording of communal purchases.

## Commands:
`doggo[,] fetch [number of edited comments to fetch, defaults to 1]`

`doggo[,] [I] bought <item> for <amount>`

## Setup:
To set up this bot, several files will need to be created.

 * Create an application using the Google Sheets API and copy the json to this folder.
 * Create spreadsheets.txt, with the first line being the spreadsheet ID, and the second line being the name of the desired sheet in the spreadsheet.
 * Create auth.txt, which contains the Discord bot authentication token.
